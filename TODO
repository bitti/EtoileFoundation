TODO EtoileFoundation
=====================

- Redesign the mirror API in order to allow the existing classes to be extended per use case (e.g. documentation, runtime reflection, code generation, access control etc.). SourceCodeKit should be able to leverage it unlike now. See:
  + Mirrors: Design Principles for Meta-level Facilities of Object: bracha.org/mirrors.pdf 
  + Proxies: Design Principles for Robust Object-oriented Intercession: soft.vub.ac.be/~tvcutsem/proxies/assets/proxies.pdf
  + Mirages: Behavioral Intercession in a Mirror-based Architecture: soft.vub.ac.be/Publications/2007/vub-prog-tr-07-16.pdf 
  + Newspeak Mixin implementation: newspeaklanguage.org
- Finish the mirror implementation and write a related test suite

- Finish metamodel implementation (validation, role classes etc.) and extend the test suite

- Get rid of glibc_hack_unistd.h if possible

- Support CommonCrypto API for iOS and Mac OS X, in addition to openssl (this can be done with some preprocessor macros easily, see how CoreObject does it)

- Add NSFastEnumeration support to NSPointerArray on GNUstep (see ETEntityDescription)

- Support additional UTIDefinitions.plist and UTIClassBindings.plist per application on iOS

	- EtoileFoundation is a static library on iOS, so the EtoileFoundation resources (UTIDefinitions.plist and UTIClassBindings.plist) are copied into the application project, and in the .app bundle, these EtoileFoundation resources appear in root directory. Both EtoileFoundation bundle and the app bundle are one and the same on iOS.

- Remove AppKit dependency

- Don't call +[NSApplication sharedApplication] in +[ETModelDescriptionRepository mainRepository]

	- this can break EtoileUI and applications that subclass NSApplication	(if +mainRepository is called before the app object is created)
	- +sharedApplication can just be called in +willRunTestSuite as EtoileUI test suite does it

- Split Collection protocols and categories into multiple files

- Add some useful HOM methods such as -flattenedCollection, -deepFlattenedCollection, -flatMappedCollection etc. and their block equivalent methods.


Known Issues
------------

- Figure out why CArray doesn't compile on Mac OS X
